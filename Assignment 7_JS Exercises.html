 <!--
 a) var z; alert(type of z) 
		This is a vairble alert, the vairble can be set to a number, charcter. 
		They store data values and will be identified by unique names
 b) alert(!!false); 
		this mean that when the web page has been visited, it should show the alert of false. However, if is written alert(!false)
		this should result in a opppsite result, meaning true. 
 c)  alert(7%2) 
		will return 1. The reason is becuase we are using the modolus  operator, meaning it is lookiing for the division remainder. 
		7%2 how many times does 2 go into 7?  6 times, meaning that 1 is left over. 
		The results should display 1. 
d) var name="Jim"; alert(name+" Smith");
	t	his is using the vairble name to establish smith as the last name. 
		var name will be Jim, and smith will already be selected as the last name. 
		changing var name will result in a different first. 
		This result will show "Jim Smith" 
 e)var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2);
		This Javascript will display myNum + x, x being 2 in the previous example. 
		so if myNum is 11, (myNum + 2) this will display 112, this will be adding 2 to the end of myNum.
		If you wanted the result alert of 222, alert(myNum + 2) 
		myNum ="22" .

 1.The difference betweeen Java and Javascript would be the fact that Javascript is a browser language  that could tell the computer how to interact 
 with the user upon specifc input, it makes the page more interactive, while Java is a object oriented programming language which is a standalone and
 can run compiled programs.
 2. The difference between + and ++ operators in Javascript is that 
 + = Addition, this means if used, it will add. Example: alert(2 + 2) = this will be 4
 ++ = Increment, so if it is 5++ the answer should be 6. 
 i++ = i = i + 1, this means that the number is in a increment to add one to a vairble. 
 ++ eliminates the equal sign
 3. The Difference between  window.alert(), console.log(), and document.write()
 -window.alert() window.alert is an alert box that can display specific messages.. 
 -console.log is a method to write messages to the console, it can be seen once the console is pulled up. F12 should pull up the console in a browser
 -document.write creates HTML expressions or Code from Javascript to a document.
  It can be used with document.write("<h1> explanation </h1> 
  that should display as "explanation" on the webpage. 
  4. differences between =, ==, and the === operators.
  = - this means equal, this can be seen when you use vairble like x = 5, 
  == - this means equal to, will return as a true or false statement. 
		so if you set x= 10, 
		x===7 will be false, x==10 will be true since x is 10. 
  === - this means equal value and equal type. this response will be true or false, this is also seen as a comparision operator.
		so if x is set to 5
		x===5 that will be true 
		x===4 that will be false  since x= 5
		x==="5" that will be false since x =5
		if x = "5" 
		x===5 will be true 
		x===4 will be false, since x = "5"
		x==="5" will be true, since x= "5"  
	5. Describe the differences between two types of loops: while and do while.
	while- this will loop through a block of code when the condition is true,  example setting while(i<25) 
	do/while - this will be a variant of the while loop but will execute once before checking the condition if true or false, t will repeat 
	if it is true. 
		do{ code to used }
			while (condition)
